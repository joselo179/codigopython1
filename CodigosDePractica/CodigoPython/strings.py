#strings in python are sorrounded by either single or double quotation marks.
#lets look at string formatting and some string metods

name = "Joselo"
age = 30


#Concatenate
print("hello, my name is "Joselo" and I am str "30"))

#better way

#string formatting

#arguments by position
print("My name is {Joselo} and I am {30}.format(name=name,age=age))
#{}==basically place holders
